# Digital Garden Compiler

This tool is a compiler for my digital garden managed via obsidian.
My whole workflow is inside obsidian, and using some properties, I can extract and manage my digital garden online easily, this program extract the files, apply some changes and transform to HTML template. Then, I use a small server I built with Go to build from template, static HTML assets which I can deploy to an S3 bucket and have my website working
